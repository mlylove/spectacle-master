# Contributing

Contributions come in many forms. Creating an issue that documents a previously unreported defect is just as important as sending a pull request. Spectacle can only be great when the folks that use it are passionate about its quality.

Before you start working on your contribution to Spectacle please keep reading. For even more information read [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub][1].

## Issues

Before creating a new issue check and make sure somebody hasn't already beat you to it. _Please take this time to also review Spectacle's [common issues][2]_. If your defect or feature request doesn't already exist feel free to create a new issue. When creating a new issue take the time to be as clear and descriptive as possible.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when creating an issue for a potential defect:

* What version of Spectacle did you use when encountering the defect?
* What version of OS X did you use when encountering the defect?
* Was there any relevant Spectacle output in the [Console][3]?

Including screenshots or videos are extremely helpful so please include them if you can. Diagrams can also be highly valuable when describing a new feature in a feature request.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`
2. Add tests if your changes can and should be tested
3. Run the test suite and confirm that all tests pass
4. Rebase your changes on top of the most recent changes from `master`

## Coding Style

To help make it easier maintain Spectacle please match the existing coding style as much as possible. This make it easier to both understand and merge your contributions. Only use two __spaces__ for indentation.
